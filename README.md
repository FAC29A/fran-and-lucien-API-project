## Welcome to Bookster!
What's Bookster, you ask? It's an app that utilises data from the Project OpenLibrary and The New York Times APIs, fusing the magic of literature and technology to help you discover your next literary adventure. We're all about unlocking new horizons in the world of reading! Not sure what to read next? Well look no further...

## Features
### General search
- Users can search for books by title, author or subject
- Results displayed are sorted by rating, with highest-rated books displayed first
- Book covers, descriptions and ratings are shown when available

### NY times bestsellers
- On the left, theere is a display of the top 3 current bestsellers

## Project Milestones
- Finding an API which worked!
- Displaying images for books from the open library API
- Working around the 429 error when we had made too many requests (showing errors or alternate content so the site was still usable)

### User Stories 
**Core Stories**
As a user, I want to:
- See an interesting mashup of book data
- Input a title, an author or a subject and get a list of results
- View the app on all of my devices
- Find out about the latest bestsellers for different genres
- Have a direct link to the Amazon purchase page for each book
- As a student or teacher, I need to find books related to a subject
- I want the highest rated books to be displayed first
- I don't want too many books- keep the lists to a maximum of 10!

**Stretch stories**
- As an impatient user, I want to see some indication that data is loading
- As a confused user, I want to be told when something goes wrong

### How to Use
- Clone the repository and open the Index.html file in your browser (you can also visit [Bookster](https://fac29a.github.io/fran-and-lucien-API-project/))
- In the search bar, type in a subject, an author or the title of a book and press the arrow button
- If you don't want to search for anything specific, click on one of the genres to view the latest bestsellers!
N.B. If you are getting a 429 response- please try an alternative API key!!
